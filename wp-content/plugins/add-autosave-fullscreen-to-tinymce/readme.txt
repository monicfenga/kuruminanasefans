This adds the AutoSave and Fullscreen plugins to your TinyMCE toolbar.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that I have written to install the following **TinyMCE** plugins (not to be confused with *Wordpress* plugins) to your TinyMCE toolbar:

* [Autosave](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/autosave/ "Autosave plugin | Docs | TinyMCE")
* [Full Screen](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/fullscreen/ "Full Screen plugin | Docs | TinyMCE")

There are no settings or anything for this plugin. Just install it and away you go!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why make a plugin for TinyMCE? Isn't Gutenberg the way to go now? =

It is true that Gutenberg is now the standard for editing pages and posts with WordPress. However, on my site I use bbPress and it can only support the TinyMCE toolbar.

== Screenshots ==

1. Sample TinyMCE toolbar with the Full Screen plugin activated. Note, your toolbar might look different to this one.
2. The Autosave TinyMCE toolbar plugin in action.
